2 tbsp butter
1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
3-4 tbsp milk


1. Melt the butter in your saucepan on medium heat.

2. Add in the brown sugar and stir till it is all wet. Do not over mix. Just swirl the pan every so often.

3. Let the mixture come to a boil. Keep an eye on it. Things will happen fast so be ready with your ingredients!

4. Keep watching. The mixture will turn from a goopy sand to almost liquid... (Takes about 3-5 mins)

5. Turn down the heat and add the milk and whisk away!

6. The sugar will protest. But they will get along soon enough! Just keep whisking!

7. Turn the heat back to medium and let the caramel mixture boil a minute or two. Stirring occasionally.

8. It should become a smooth velvety glaze.
